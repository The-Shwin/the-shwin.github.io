This is the repository for my website. You can find it at [theshwin.com](theshwin.com). 

I cloned this repository from [academicpages](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io). I then made changes to the css/scss files (color, font, hyperlink styles, etc.) and the content. I am using CloudFlare for the HTTPS.
