About Me
======
I am a senior at Johns Hopkins University and I am graduating in May. I am primarily interested in computer engineering and robotics. I enjoy working with both hardware and software.

I like learning new skills in computer engineering and playing with new technology. Some of my other interests are listed [here](https://theshwin.com/fun_facts/).
