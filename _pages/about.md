About Me
======
I recently finished my undergraduate studies at Johns Hopkins University in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. I am primarily interested in computer engineering and robotics. I enjoy working with both hardware and software.

I am currently working as a Computer Engineer at Galen Robotics, a surgical robotics startup. 

I like learning new skills and playing with new technology. Some of my other interests are listed [here](https://theshwin.com/fun_facts/).
