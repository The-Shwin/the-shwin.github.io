About Me
======
I am currently a senior at Johns Hopkins University and I am graduating in May. I am primarily interested in computer engineering and robotics. I enjoy working with both hardware and software.

I like learning new skills in computer engineering and playing with new technology. Some of my other interests are listed [here](https://theshwin.com/fun_facts/).


Origin Story
======
I am originally from Miami, Florida. It's a pretty nice city. If you want to avoid melting in the heat, I would recommend going there during the winter (when it is usually <70 degrees Fahrenheit). When I was in high school, I conducted materials science/engineering research. That was what sparked my interest in engineering. Once I started college, I picked up programming and electronics and I decided to major in computer engineering.
