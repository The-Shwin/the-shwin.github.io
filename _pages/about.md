About Me
======
I am currently working at Twitch.

I finished my undergraduate studies at Johns Hopkins University in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering in May of 2018. I am interested in computer engineering and robotics. I enjoy working with both hardware and software.

I like learning new skills and playing with new technology. Some of my other interests are listed [here](https://theshwin.com/fun_facts/).
