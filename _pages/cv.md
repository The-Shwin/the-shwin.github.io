Education
======
* B.S. in Computer Engineering, Johns Hopkins University
  * Graduated May 2018
  * Major: Computer Engineering
  * Minors: Robotics, Applied Mathematics & Statistics, Computer Science
  * Groups: Robotics Club, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Association for Computing Machinery, Campus Admissions (tour guide)
* International Baccalaureate Diploma, John A. Ferguson Senior High School, 2014
  * Groups: STEM Club/SECME, Mu Alpha Theta (Math Honor Society), Science Honor Society, National Honor Society, Spanish Honor Society

Experience
======
* Summer 2018: Electrical Engineering Intern
  * Galen Robotics
  * Working on electronics for a surgical robot.
  
* Fall 2016 - Spring 2018: Undergraduate Research Assistant
  * Johns Hopkins University
  * Installed newer components including flight control systems, guidance, and computers on drones for motion/planning research. Researched and implemented motion-based teleoperation for a robotic arm attached to a drone for use in object manipulation. Wrote packages to allow for control of a robotic arm via a Razer Hydra motion gaming controller. Implemented first person view teleoperation for aerial object manipulation.
  * Supervisor: Professor Marin Kobilarov

* Summer 2017: Undergraduate Research Assistant
  * Florida International University
  * Applied advanced statistical techniques such as principal component analysis to improve hyper parameter selection for use in augmented terrain-based navigation by robots. Developed a method for assigning weights to water parameters while reducing correlation. Used these selection and weighting techniques to develop an algorithm for reducing autocorrelation to create data maps for underwater localization by combining selected parameters and their weights.
