Here are some of my interests outside of work.

I enjoy reading, watching TV/movies, and playing board games. I also like a good cold brew coffee. 
I am a mechanical keyboard enthusiast. I recently made my first custom keyboard build. Navigate [here](https://theshwin.com/keyboards/) if you are interested in seeing pictures.
