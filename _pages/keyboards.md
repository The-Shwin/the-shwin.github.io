## Custom Build #1: Mysterium High Profile Tenkeyless Keyboard
* This is my first custom keyboard. Got this from groupbuy of someone else's design which is [open-source](https://github.com/coseyfannitutti/mysterium). Much thanks to the designer!
* Most custom keyboards have surface mount boards with only the switches left to be soldered, but this one is extra fun because it is through-hole. 
* Every mechanical switch has additional lubricant on it to increase the smoothness.
