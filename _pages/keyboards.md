## Custom Build #1: Mysterium High Profile Tenkeyless Keyboard
* This is my first custom keyboard. The design is actually [open-source](https://github.com/coseyfannitutti/mysterium)
* Typically, the assembler would only have to solder the mechanical switches with many mechanical keyboard builds.
* The fun part about making this my first custom is unlike other keyboards which are sourced with the surface-mount components already soldered on, I was able to get the bare PCB and the through-hole components and do all the soldering myself. 
* Every mechanical switch has additional lubricant on it to increase the smoothness.
